The first is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of college but stayed around for classes I found interesting, like calligraphy. Years later, this knowledge helped design the Macintosh with beautiful typography. You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking back. Trust your journey.

The second story is about love and loss. I was fired from Apple, a company I started, but it freed me to explore new creative paths. I started NeXT, Pixar, and met my wife. Sometimes life hits you hard, but don’t lose faith. Keep doing what you love.

The third story is about death. Being diagnosed with cancer reminded me that time is limited. Don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Follow your heart and intuition; they somehow know where you need to be.

Stay hungry, stay foolish.
